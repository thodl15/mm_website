        question: "Do you offer full coverage?",
        answer: "We offer four different levels of liability protection as well as choices for your comprehensive and collision deductibles. Please keep in mind that financing and leasing companies may have their own coverage requirements, so please verify before choosing your coverage limits."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I have more than one vehicle on my policy? Is there a multi-car discount?",
        answer: "Yes. You can add multiple vehicles while completing a quote online. Our multi-car discount will save you money on each vehicle’s base rate and per-mile rate. If you’re already a policyholder, please give us a call and we can update your policy."
    },
    {
        question: "How are the base and per-mile rates determined?",
        answer: "Just like other insurance companies, several factors are considered when creating your unique base and per-mile rate. These can include: driver age, credit history (state specific), type of vehicle, driver history, and length of prior insurance (state specific)."
    },
    {
        question: "What if I drive over 10,000 miles? Will my rate go up?",
        answer: "You will never be penalized or have your rate increase purely because of an increase in annual miles. You are allowed to drive as much as you’d like, but just keep in mind that you will be charged for each mile that you drive up to 250/day (150/day in New Jersey)."
    },
    {
        question: "How does billing work?",
        answer: "You’re charged for your first month’s base rate when you purchase a policy, plus any required prepayment. At the end of the first month, you’ll be charged for the next month’s base rate as well as any miles driven during the previous month. That way, you’ll only receive one bill each month. We also set you up for automatic billing when you first sign up, so there’s no need to worry about missed payments. If you ever need to update your billing information, you can login to your online account."
